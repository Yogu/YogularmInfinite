				Yogularm Infinite is a Java game in which <b>Yogu</b> - the player - jumps and runs through an
				<b>auto-generated</b> 2-dimensional world. As the name says, it is impossible to finish the
				game. However, the goal is to collect as many <b>coins</b> as possibly. <b>Chicken</b> make
				their own way through the dizzy air, and you have to take care of <b>arrow shooters</b>...

				<p>
					Yogularm Infinite is available on all platforms supported by Java. Make sure you have
					<a href="http://www.java.com/de/download/">the latest version of Java</a> installed. Then, click the
					green button and open it with the <b>Java(TM) Web Start Launcher</b>.

					<span class="version">Version 0.1.3.5 Alpha</span>
				</a></p>
				
				<p>
					Note: You will be asked whether you really want to start the appliction, because id requires full access
					over your computer. Unfortunately, there is currently no alternative.

					Call me Yogu (yes, like the round yellow character in the game) and contact me via
					<a href="mailto:info@yogularm.de">info@yogularm.de</a>.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					If you have any trouble starting or playing the game, please let me know. If you have an idea what could
					be added, improved or changed, let me know, too. The project is in an early-development state and needs
					your feedback!

					<h2>Future</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
					The game in its current state is fully-playable, so maybe I'll close the project. But of course it can
					be improved, and feature suggestions are always <a href="mailto:info@yogularm.de">welcome</a>. If you
					can develop in Java, ask me for the source code and implement your ideas if you want to.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Maybe I'll add more, especially mobile, enemies, which try to push you off the platforms. Also I thought
					of moving platforms you have to jump on for moving over a large gap.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The current world builder is called Sky, because it creates platforms in the air. Other
					world builders would be possible, for example an underground lava cave or an underwater world.

					<h2>History</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
					The first version of Yogularm is dated back to 2006, written in
					<a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com">BlitzBasic</a>. Since then, it accompanied me in my way through
					different programming languages. 2009, I rewrote the complete game in
					<a href="http://www.delphigl.com">Delphi and OpenGL</a>. 2010 I had the idea of making it 3d, and I
					began writing code in Visual C# (and OpenGL), but I gave it up very early. Yogularm was not intended to
					be three-dimensional.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					All those versions had one in common: The levels had to be created by human intelligence using a level
					editor. I had the idea of people inventing new levels and sharing them in a forum. But for that working
					fine Yogularm simply had too few players. I don't remember how many times I played my own levels of
					which I knew every detail by heart. It was not that fun playing it in every coffee break.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This year, in 2011, I got a new favorite computer game:
					<a href="http://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>, a sandbox game - with an auto-generated world.
					Each time staring a new world, it is completely difficult - but always very interesting. I wondered
					if this would be applicable to a jump'n'run game. And so I started developing Yogularm Infinite.
