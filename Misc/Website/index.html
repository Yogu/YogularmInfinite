				Yogularm Infinite is a Java game in which <b>Yogu</b> - the player - jumps and runs through an
				<b>auto-generated</b> 2-dimensional world. As the name says, it is impossible to finish the
				game. However, the goal is to collect as many <b>coins</b> as possibly. <b>Chicken</b> make
				their own way through the dizzy air, and you have to watch out for <b>arrows</b>...

					<h2>Recent changes</h2>
				</header>	
						
				<h3>Version 0.3.2 Alpha</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Performance Update:</b> Fixed a memory leak (Previously, the RAM usage grew very quickly and significantly).
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Icon:</b> Added an icon for the game window in the desktop version.
					</li>
				</ul>		
						
				<h3>Version 0.3.1 Alpha</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Crash fixed:</b> Yogularm crashed on some devices, especially on several Android phones. This is now fixed.
						(Technical Information: The textures' dimensions were no powers of two, so some video cards could not load
						them).
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Bug reporting:</b> If the Android App crashes, it displays a detailed error message. If this happens to
						you, please copy the message by  
					</li>
				</ul>
							
				<h3>Version 0.3 Alpha</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Yogularm for Android:</b> Yogularm is available as Android app. You have to
						download, copy to your sd card and open it from there because I don't want to
						pay USD 25,00 to place it in the Market.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Version 0.2 Alpha</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Platforms:</b> Propeller-powered wooden platforms carry you over large gaps.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Ladders:</b> Sometimes, it is neccessary to climb a little upwards. 
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Physics:</b> For ladders and especially platforms to work properly, the physics engine
						has been changed significantly.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Version 0.1.5 Alpha</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Animations:</b> Yogu and the chicken are now animated! Whether walking, flying or being hurt - the characters
						now are more lively.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Yogu gets thinner:</b> In previous versions, you could stand half on air when the hand was over a stone. Note
						that although you'll have to get used to the new behavior, it is now more realistic. 
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Yogularm on small screens:</b> If your desktop resolution is smaller than 1024x768 (or if you like
						to run the game in a smaller window), the game is now better to play.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Version 0.1.4.1 Alpha</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Reduced air grip:</b> While flying in the air, the direction now changes more slowly than when
						standing on ground. Much more realistic.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Yogu wiggle fix:</b> When the performance was inconsistent, Yogu sometimes began to jump in
						little steps even when touching none of the controls.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Camera wiggle fix:</b> Previously, the camera began to shake when the window was too small.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>New certificate:</b> I'm very sorry, but the certificates the game was signed up to the last
						version became public, so they are no longer trustful. In this version, I have changed them.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Version 0.1.4.0 Alpha</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Physics Engine:</b> The physics was updated to be more realistic, allowing to push chicken or
						even ride them for a short while.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Collision Fix:</b> In the previous version, the player sometimes seemed to jump to another
						position on collision. This is (hopefully) fixed now.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Open Source:</b> The source code of Yogularm Infinite is now available on
						<a href="https://github.com/Yogu/YogularmInfinite">github</a>. Happy coding!
					</li>
				</ul>

					<h2>Future</h2>

				<p>
					The game in its current state is fully-playable, so maybe I'll close the project. But of course it can
					be improved, and feature suggestions are always <a href="mailto:info@yogularm.de">welcome</a>. If you
					can develop in Java, get the
					<a href="https://github.com/Yogu/YogularmInfinite">source code fromgithub</a> and feel free to
					implement your ideas. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Maybe I'll add more, especially mobile, enemies, which try to push you off the platforms. The
					current world builder is called Sky, because it creates platforms in the air. Other
					world builders would be possible, for example an underground lava cave or an underwater world.

					<h2>History</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
					The <a href="http://www.yogularm.de/download-yogularm.htm"
					title="Description, screenshots and download of Yogularm 1">first version of Yogularm</a> is dated
					back to 2006, written in <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com" title="The official BlitzBasic homepage">
					BlitzBasic</a>. Since then, it accompanied me in my way through different programming languages. 2009,
					I <a href="http://www.yogularm.de/game" title="Download Yogularm 2">rewrote the complete game</a> in
					<a href="http://www.delphigl.com" title="A forum for developers using Delphi and OpenGL">Delphi and
					OpenGL</a>. 2010 I had the idea of making it 3d, and I began writing code in
					<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kx37x362.aspx" title="Starting point of Visual C#
					in the Microsoft Developer Ntwork">Visual C#</a> (and <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Tao"
					title="The homepage of Tao, a .NET wrapper of OpenGL">OpenGL</a>), but I gave it up very early.
					Yogularm was not intended to be three-dimensional.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					All those versions had one in common: The levels had to be created by human intelligence using a level
					editor. I had the idea of people inventing new levels and sharing them in a forum. But for that working
					fine Yogularm simply had too few players. I don't remember how many times I played my own levels of
					which I knew every detail by heart. It was not that fun playing it in every coffee break.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This year, in 2011, I got a new favorite computer game:
					<a href="http://www.minecraft.net" title="The offical homepage of Minecraft">Minecraft</a>, a sandbox
					game - with an auto-generated world. Each time staring a new world, it is completely difficult -
					but always very interesting. I wondered if this would be applicable to a jump'n'run game. And so I
					started developing Yogularm Infinite.
