				Yogularm Infinite is a Java game in which <b>Yogu</b> - the player - jumps and runs through an
				<b>auto-generated</b> 2-dimensional world. As the name says, it is impossible to finish the
				game. However, the goal is to collect as many <b>coins</b> as possibly. <b>Chicken</b> make
				their own way through the dizzy air, and you have to take care of <b>arrow shooters</b>...

					<h2>Want to try it out?</h2> 
				</header>
			
				<p>
					Yogularm Infinite is available on all platforms supported by Java. Make sure you have
					<a href="http://www.java.com/de/download/">the latest version of Java</a> installed. Then, click the
					green button and open it with the <b>Java(TM) Web Start Launcher</b>.
				</p>
				
				<p class="download"><a href="http://www.yogularm.de/infinite/code/YogularmWebStart.jnlp">
					<span>Start Yogularm Infinite</span>
					<span class="version">Version 0.1.4.1 Alpha</span>
				</a></p>
				
				<p class="note">
					<strong>Note:</strong> If you have started Yogularm in a previous version, make sure the old one is
					deleted. You can delete YogularmInfinte by executing <i>javaws -viewer</i> and chosing
					the application then.
				</p>
				
				<p class="important">
					<strong>Important</strong>: If you chose to always trust the author of Yogularm in version up to
					0.1.4.0, please undo this. Unfortunately, they have become public and are no longer trustful. You can
					edit the certificates by executing <i>javaws -viewer</i> in the command line and going to the
					<i>Security</i> section. Please apologize my beginner's mistake.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Note: You will be asked whether you really want to start the appliction, because it requires full access
					over your computer. Unfortunately, there is currently no alternative.

					If you have any trouble starting or playing the game, please let me know. If you have an idea what could

					<h2>Recent changes</h2>
				</header>
				
				<h3>Version 0.1.4.1 Alpha</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Reduced air grip:</b> While flying in the air, the direction now changes more slowly than when
						standing on ground. Much more realistic.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Yogu wiggle fix:</b> When the performance was inconsistent, Yogu sometimes began to jump in
						little steps even when touching none of the controls.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Camera wiggle fix:</b> Previously, the camera began to shake when the window was too small.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>New certificate:</b> I'm very sorry, but the certificates the game was signed up to the last
						version became public, so they are no longer trustful. In this version, I have changed them.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Version 0.1.4.0 Alpha</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Physics Engine:</b> The physics was updated to be more realistic, allowing to push chicken or
						even ride them for a short while.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Collision Fix:</b> In the previous version, the player sometimes seemed to jump to another
						position on collision. This is (hopefully) fixed now.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						<b>Open Source:</b> The source code of Yogularm Infinite is now available on
						<a href="https://github.com/Yogu/YogularmInfinite">github</a>. Happy coding!
					</li>
				</ul>

					<h2>Future</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
					The game in its current state is fully-playable, so maybe I'll close the project. But of course it can
					be improved, and feature suggestions are always <a href="mailto:info@yogularm.de">welcome</a>. If you
					can develop in Java, get the
					<a href="https://github.com/Yogu/YogularmInfinite">source code fromgithub</a> and feel free to
					implement your ideas. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Maybe I'll add more, especially mobile, enemies, which try to push you off the platforms. Also I thought
					of moving platforms you have to jump on for moving over a large gap.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The current world builder is called Sky, because it creates platforms in the air. Other
					world builders would be possible, for example an underground lava cave or an underwater world.

					<h2>History</h2>
				</header>
				
				<p>
					The <a href="http://www.yogularm.de/download-yogularm.htm"
					title="Description, screenshots and download of Yogularm 1">first version of Yogularm</a> is dated
					back to 2006, written in <a href="http://www.blitzbasic.com" title="The official BlitzBasic homepage">
					BlitzBasic</a>. Since then, it accompanied me in my way through different programming languages. 2009,
					I <a href="http://www.yogularm.de/game" title="Download Yogularm 2">rewrote the complete game</a> in
					<a href="http://www.delphigl.com" title="A forum for developers using Delphi and OpenGL">Delphi and
					OpenGL</a>. 2010 I had the idea of making it 3d, and I began writing code in
					<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kx37x362.aspx" title="Starting point of Visual C#
					in the Microsoft Developer Ntwork">Visual C#</a> (and <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Tao"
					title="The homepage of Tao, a .NET wrapper of OpenGL">OpenGL</a>), but I gave it up very early.
					Yogularm was not intended to be three-dimensional.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					All those versions had one in common: The levels had to be created by human intelligence using a level
					editor. I had the idea of people inventing new levels and sharing them in a forum. But for that working
					fine Yogularm simply had too few players. I don't remember how many times I played my own levels of
					which I knew every detail by heart. It was not that fun playing it in every coffee break.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This year, in 2011, I got a new favorite computer game:
					<a href="http://www.minecraft.net" title="The offical homepage of Minecraft">Minecraft</a>, a sandbox
					game - with an auto-generated world. Each time staring a new world, it is completely difficult -
					but always very interesting. I wondered if this would be applicable to a jump'n'run game. And so I
					started developing Yogularm Infinite.
