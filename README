Yogularm Infinite
=================

Yogu Yogularm Infinite is a Java game in which Yogu - the player - jumps and runs through an auto-generated 2-dimensional world. As the name says, it is impossible to finish the game. However, the goal is to collect as many coins as possibly. Chicken make their own way through the dizzy air, and you have to take care of arrow shooters... 

How to start Yogularm Infinite
==============================

If you have the latest version of Java installed, simply execute the file exe/YogularmWebStart.jnlp.

How to develop
==============

1. Eclipse (http://eclipse.org/) must be installed.
2. Select File > Import > General > Existing Projects into workspace and choose this folder
3. Setup the JOGL user library
3.1 Select Window > Preferences > Java > Build Path > User Libraries > New and name it JOGL
3.2 Click Add JARs to add ./exe/*.all.jar and ./exe/*.your-platform.jar
3.3 Expand the platform specific jars, and set the library location to ./Thirdparty/jogl-native-libraries/your-platform
3.4 Select Project > Prperties > Java Bild Path > Libraries and make sure that the JOGL library is included here.
4. Build the project and launch it using the de.yogularm.launcher.SwingLauncher class
5. The web starter as described above does no longer work because the file Yogularm.jar is not signed. To fix that problem, you have to generate a key file
5.1 On Windows, you maybe have to add the jdk/bin folder to your PATH environment variable.
5.2 Switch to the ./dev folder in this project
5.3 run keytool -genkey -keystore yogularmKeys -alias yogularmKeys
5.4 You will be asked to enter personal information, and to specify a password. Insert the password in this file in the line <property name="keypass" value="-here-" />
5.5 Save the workspace and build (or run) again.

It is recommended to fork the git reporsitory available on http://github.com/Yogu/YogularmInfinite.
