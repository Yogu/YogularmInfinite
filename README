Yogularm Infinite
=================

Yogu Yogularm Infinite is a Java game in which Yogu - the player - jumps and runs through an auto-generated 2-dimensional world. As the name says, it is impossible to finish the game. However, the goal is to collect as many coins as possibly. Chicken make their own way through the dizzy air, and you have to take care of arrow shooters... 

How to start Yogularm Infinite
==============================

If you have the latest version of Java installed, simply execute the file exe/YogularmWebStart.jnlp.

How to develop
==============

1. Eclipse (http://eclipse.org/) must be installed, and this reporsitory downloaded completely.
2. Create a new Java project, but do not use the default location but the one this reporsitory is placed.
3. Setup the JOGL user library:
   1. Select Window > Preferences > Java > Build Path > User Libraries > New and name it JOGL
   2. Click Add JARs to add ./Thirdparty/jogl/jar/*.all.jar and ./Thirdparty/jogl/jar/*.your-platform.jar
   3. Expand the platform specific jars, and set the library location to ./Thirdparty/jogl/your-platform
   4. Select Project > Properties > Java Bild Path > Libraries and include the JOGL user library
4. Build the project and launch it using the de.yogularm.launcher.SwingLauncher class

You can export the project to a jar file using File > Export.

Java WebStart is a little bit more complicated to set up. Instructions can be found under
http://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Using_JOGL_in_Java_Web_Start

It is recommended to fork the git reporsitory available on http://github.com/Yogu/YogularmInfinite. If you do
so, please .gitignore the Eclipse project files and binaries.
