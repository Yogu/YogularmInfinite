Yogularm Infinite
=================

Yogularm Infinite is a Java game in which Yogu - the player - jumps and runs
through an auto-generated 2-dimensional world. As the name says, it is
impossible to finish the game. However, the goal is to collect as many coins as
possibly. Chickens make their own way through the dizzy air, and you have to
watch out for arrows... 

How to start Yogularm Infinite
==============================

This repository does not contain the binary files of Yogularm. Either follow
the steps below to set up Eclipse, or start Yogularm from the web at
http://www.yogularm.de/infinite/.

How to develop
==============

1. Eclipse (http://eclipse.org/) must be installed, and this repository
   downloaded completely.
   - If you want to develop for android, install the android sdk next:
     http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
2. Import the projects (de.yogularm.common and is required, the others are
   optional) into your workspace.
3. If you want to develop for desktop, set up the correct native libraries:
   Create a symbolic link from de.yogularm.desktop/build/.classpath-PLATFORM
   (where PLATFORM is your platform, e.g. win32 or linux64) to
   de.yogularm.desktop/.classpath . Alternatively, you can create a copy
   instad.
4. If you want to distribute your own edition of Yogularm, you should set up
   Java WebStart. If you only want to run it locally, you don't need this step.
   - Read the article about how to create keystore [1]
   - Save the keystore as de.yogularm.desktop/build/keystore
   - Copy de.yogularm.desktop/build/default.properties to build.properties and
     insert the storepass as value for sign.storepass
5. Build the complete workspace. It may be neccessary to open a java file, make
   a little change, save it, undo the change and save it again before compiling.
6. Open the file de.yogularm.desktop/src/de.yogularm.desktop/SwingLauncher.java
   and run it as a Java Application.

It is recommended to fork the git repository available on
http://github.com/Yogu/YogularmInfinite. If you do so, please .gitignore the
Eclipse project files and binaries.
